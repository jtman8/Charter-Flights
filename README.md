# Charter-Flights
This project was something that I quickly generated for a friend. For her job, she was supposed to manually collect information about specific charter flights from a system called Avinode. However, this task was tedious and required her to click each flight on the page individually in order to access the information she needed. Accordingly, I used Selenium in Python to automate this process.
